# Description
This GitHub repo has the source code for the new Code::Blocks GDB/MI debugger. The source is to be built with the current C::B nightly and a GCC compiler that supports C++11. The code is desigend for GDB 9 or later using the GDB/MI version 3 interface.

This uses the GDB Machine Interface instead of the old annotations (deprecated) interface. This has a number of advantages:

1. Supports all of the existing GDB debugger features once finished
2. Quicker
3. Supports GDB Python pretty printing if GDB supports it.
4. Should be easier easier to add new features compared to the old code.
5. GDB/MI interface is supported.

**The debugger is not production quality at this point in time.**

**It can be tested NOW, so give it a go in order to help with finding missing functionality and/or bugs.**

# OUTSTANDING ITEMS

## High Priority
1. Fix broken items in the list. So far they are:
    a) Call stack:
        - Double click on entry should open and go to the line
    b) Disable break point
    c) Show tty for console projects 
   
## Medium Priority
1. Conditional break points:
        - add
        - edit
        - update
        - remove
2. Debug Memory view dialog
3. Disassembly view
4. Add control to vary the amount/type of logging
5. Publish plugin to github

## Low Priority

1. Create Linux project file
2. Create MacOS project file
3. Update Linux makefile build process
4. Update MSYS2 makefile build process
5. Update MacOS makefile build process
6. CPU registry dialog modify to fix value column to say 50 characters.
