# Description
This GitHub repo has the source code for the new Code::Blocks GDB/MI debugger. The source is to be built with the current C::B nightly and a GCC compiler that supports C++11. The code is desigend for GDB 9 or later using the GDB/MI version 3 interface.

This uses the GDB Machine Interface instead of the old annotations (deprecated) interface. This has a number of advantages:

1. Supports all of the existing GDB debugger features once finished
2. Quicker
3. Supports GDB Python pretty printing if GDB supports it.
4. Should be easier easier to add new features compared to the old code.
5. The GDB/MI interface is support.

**The debugger is not production quality at this point in time.** 
**It can be tested NOW, so give it a go in order to help with finding missing functionality and/or bugs.**
